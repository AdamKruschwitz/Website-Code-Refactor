# Website Code Refactor
A refactored website for Horiseon, a ficticious SEO and social media management company. Used as an assignment for the Berkley Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. 

## About
In this assignment, we were given some code for Horiseon's  website which had some issues with accessability and readability. Our goal was to maintain the look of the website while improving the underlying code.

I was able to find a few quick issues to fix. First, the link to the "Search Engine Optimization" section was broken due to a missing id attribute. Many of the classes used were redundant, so I consolidated them into more simple, descriptive classes and eliminated redundancy in the CSS. Much of the HTML used div's instead of semantic tags, so I changed many of these to reflect their function on the website. Lastly, I added alt descriptions to each of the images to accomodate screen readers. 

Through the research I performed for this project, I learned more about accessibility standards and semantic HTML tags, and I learned how to use the Lighthouse accessibility auditor to check my work. 

## Work done
1. Replace div tags with more semantic tags
2. Ensure all class names are appropriate and semantic
3. Fix any bugs surrounding page links
4. Remove unnecessary redundancy from CSS
5. Commented in HTML and CSS

7. Checked my work with Lighthouse
8. Created README.md for the project
9. Hosted the site using GitHub Pages
